> Kotlin for android app development !!!

The ```Kotlin``` is a general-purpose cross-platform programming language developed by JetBrains to be fully interoperable with Java.

Get started!!!
You use a tool called a ```code editor``` to write and edit your code. It's similar to a text editor in which you can write and edit text, but a code editor also provides functionality to help you write code more accurately. 


#### For example, 
``` A code editor shows autocomplete suggestions while you type, and displays error messages when code is incorrect.```

To practice the basics of the ```Kotlin language```, you will use an interactive code editor called the ```Kotlin Playground```. You can access it from a web browser, so you don't need to install any software on your computer. You can edit and run Kotlin code directly in the Kotlin Playground and see the output.

#### Note:
> * You can't build Android apps within the Kotlin Playground. In later pathways, you will install and use a tool called Android Studio to write and edit your Android app code.

> * A source code written in Kotlin is saved with ```. kt``` extension which is commonly known as Kotlin file extension.

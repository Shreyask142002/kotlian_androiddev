The variable value is the actual data that's stored in the variable.

syntax:
var name:datatype=values

ex:val count: Int = 2

For the count variable example, the number 2 is the initial value of the variable.

"the count variable is initialized to 2." This means that 2 is the first value stored in the variable when the variable is declared.

The initial value will be different depending on the data type declared for the variable.

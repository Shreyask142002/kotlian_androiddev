After the variable name, you add a colon, a space, and then the data type of the variable. 
As mentioned earlier, String, Int, Double, Float, and Boolean are some of the basic Kotlin data types.


var name:datatypes=values
ex:
For the count variable example, Int is the data type of the variable.
val count: Int = 2

The following tokens act as keywords in modifier lists of declarations, and they can be used as identifiers in other contexts:

abstract marks a class or member as abstract.

actual denotes a platform-specific implementation in multiplatform projects.

annotation declares an annotation class.

companion declares a companion object.

const marks a property as a compile-time constant.

crossinline forbids non-local returns in a lambda passed to an inline function.

data instructs the compiler to generate canonical members for a class.

enum declares an enumeration.

expect marks a declaration as platform-specific, expecting an implementation in platform modules.

external marks a declaration as implemented outside of Kotlin (accessible through JNI or in JavaScript).

final forbids overriding a member.

infix allows calling a function using infix notation.

inline tells the compiler to inline a function and the lambdas passed to it at the call site.

inner allows referring to an outer class instance from a nested class.

internal marks a declaration as visible in the current module.

lateinit allows initializing a non-null property outside of a constructor.

noinline turns off inlining of a lambda passed to an inline function.

open allows subclassing a class or overriding a member.

operator marks a function as overloading an operator or implementing a convention.

out marks a type parameter as covariant.

override marks a member as an override of a superclass member.

private marks a declaration as visible in the current class or file.

protected marks a declaration as visible in the current class and its subclasses.

public marks a declaration as visible anywhere.

reified marks a type parameter of an inline function as accessible at runtime.

sealed declares a sealed class (a class with restricted subclassing).

suspend marks a function or lambda as suspending (usable as a coroutine).

tailrec marks a function as tail-recursive (allowing the compiler to replace recursion with iteration).

vararg allows passing a variable number of arguments for a parameter.

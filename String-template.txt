Follow the steps below so that the program outputs a more helpful message.

step 1:Update your program in the Kotlin Playground with the below code. 
For the println() call, pass in a string literal that contains the count variable name. 
Remember to surround the text with quotation marks. Note that this will not give you the results you expect. You'll fix the issue in a later step.


fun main() {
    val count: Int = 2
    println("You have count unread messages.")
}
step2:Run the program and the output should display:You have count unread messages.

That sentence doesn't make sense! You want the value of the count variable to be displayed in the message, not the variable name.

step 3:To fix your program, add a dollar sign symbol $ before the count variable: "You have $count unread messages." 
This is a string template because it contains a template expression, 
which is $count in this case. A template expression is an expression that gets evaluated to a value,
which then gets substituted into the string. In this case, the template expression $count evaluates to 2, 
and the 2 gets substituted into the string where the expression was located.

fun main() {
    val count: Int = 2
    println("You have $count unread messages.")
}

step 4:
When you run the program, the output matches the desired goal:You have 2 unread messages.


That sentence makes much more sense to the user!

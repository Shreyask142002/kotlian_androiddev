You must define a variable first in your code before you can use the variable.
When you define a variable, you assign a name to uniquely identify it. You also decide what type of data it can hold by specifying the data type.
Lastly, you can provide an initial value that will be stored in the variable, but this is optional.

Once you define a variable, you can use that variable in your program.
To use a variable, type out the variable name in your code, 
which tells the Kotlin compiler that you want to use the variable's value at that point in the code.

For example, define a variable for the number of unread messages in a user's inbox.
The variable can have the name count. 
Store a value such as the number 2 inside the variable, representing 2 unread messages in the user's inbox. 
(You can pick a different number to store in the variable, but for the purpose of this example, use the number 2.)

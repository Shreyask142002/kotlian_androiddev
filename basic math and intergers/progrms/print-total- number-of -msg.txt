fun main() {
    val unreadCount = 5
    val readCount = 100
    println("You have ${unreadCount + readCount} total messages in your inbox.")
}

Run the program and it should display the total number of messages in the inbox:
output:You have 105 total messages in your inbox.

For a string template, you learned that you can put the $ symbol before a single variable name. 
However, if you have a more complex expression, 
you must enclose the expression in curly braces with the $ symbol before the curly braces: ${unreadCount + readCount}. 
The expression within the curly braces, unreadCount + readCount, evaluates to 105. Then the value 105 is substituted within the string literal.

expression=Unreadcount+readcount value:105

NOTE: If you forget the curly braces around the template expression, you will get unexpected results
You can test that out in the Kotlin Playground by changing the println() statement to println("You have $unreadCount + readCount total messages in your inbox.") 
and observing the output.

To explore this topic further, create variables with different names and different initial values, and use template expressions to print messages to the output.

What is the difference between an Int variable with value 2 and a String variable with value "2"?
When they both get printed to the output, they look the same.

The advantage to storing whole number integers as an Int (as opposed to a String) is that you can perform math operations with Int variables, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication (see other operators). 
For example, two integer variables can be added together to get their sum.
There are certainly cases where it's reasonable to have integers stored as Strings, but the purpose of this section is to show you what you can do with Int variables.
